Themyscira Wireless RTP endpoint library is a software component that was
originally developed externally to Osmocom prior to being integrated into
libosmo-netif, hence its documentation has been done in a different manner
than is usual in Osmocom.

There is a detailed document titled _Guide to ThemWi RTP endpoint library_;
its original/official ThemWi version resides here:

https://www.freecalypso.org/TW-doc/twrtp-guide-latest.pdf
(See TW-doc directory listing for other formats and previous versions.)

There also exists a version of this document whose content has been updated
to reflect changes to twrtp & twjit made as part of Osmocom integration,
and which can be edited further in sync with code changes - however, the
formatting language in which this document is written is still troff.
twrtp-guide.t is the troff source for the Osmocom-adapted version of twrtp
guide document; to compile it into readable PDF, run this command:

groff -p -t -ms -Tpdf twrtp-guide.t > twrtp-guide.pdf

groff is classic, old school GNU software that should be easily available
in any GNU+Linux distribution.
